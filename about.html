      <h2>Who I am?</h2>
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Edmundo Salamanca, a passionate front-end developer and future full-stack
        developer. With 3+ years of experience in web development and a strong foundation in React,
        I possess a diverse skill set that includes a wide range of front-end technologies such as
        CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, as well as various libraries and frameworks like Next.js,
        ReactJs, Redux, i18n, Tailwind, and Vue.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a person, I am dynamic, efficient, and highly communicative, with a passion for
        technology and a continuous thirst for learning. My ability to work collaboratively and
        deliver high-quality work under budget and on time makes me an asset to any project.
      </p>
      <h2>Assignment description</h2>
      <p>
        In this assignment, I've enhanced the browsing experience by using a fake store API to
        populate the cards on my homepage. While the products featured are fictitious, this approach
        allows me to create an engaging and visually appealing presentation of what I offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        These cards showcase a variety of products with images, descriptions, and prices, providing
        an immersive and interactive experience. When you click on the see more button on each card,
        you are going to see the full description of the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you appreciate the unique content I've curated
        using the fake store API.
